dumbass.php
dumbasssubmit.php worked from A

latlon.php
latlonsubmit.php did NOT work from A

i think it has something to do with cross-site-scripting (XSS) and networkadmins at A configuring network to counter.
Also something to do with inside console.developers.google.com when you make the API key you restrict the key to specific "http referrers".
