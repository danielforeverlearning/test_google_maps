dumbass.php
dumbasssubmit.php worked from A

latlon.php
latlonsubmit.php did NOT work from A

(1) i think it has something to do with cross-site-scripting (XSS) and networkadmins at A configuring network to counter.
Also something to do with inside console.developers.google.com when you make the API key you restrict the key to specific "http referrers".

(2) ok when i previously uploads AAA.html then it worked........today it did not work got the same suspicious filter from A .....
but when i uploaded BBB.html it worked ..... therefore suspicious filtering must logged url for AAA.html as suspicious because the key was not valid for 5 minutes till it was made valid by google after 5 minutes. (i think)

(3) ok ... about an hour or so later, i got completely locked out of mydomain ..... network admin power.
